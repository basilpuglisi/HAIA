# HAIA-RECCLIN Data Immunization Protocol (v1.0)
*A public research framework for governed AI data integrity*

### Overview
The HAIA-RECCLIN Data Immunization Protocol (v1.0) extends the principles of the HAIA-RECCLIN model into a practical safeguard for the age of large-scale artificial intelligence.
Its purpose is not only to detect anomalies or data poisoning but to establish a repeatable structure where human arbitration, cross-AI verification, and transparent traceability form the foundation of system trust.

Modern AI systems can be compromised by a handful of corrupted samples, as recent research from Anthropic, Oxford, and the Alan Turing Institute has shown.
HAIA-RECCLIN responds by reframing security as a governance function, not a scaling problem.
It transforms validation into a continuous, multi-intelligence conversation — across models, roles, and humans — to contain emergent risk before it propagates.

## 1. Conceptual Foundation

The Human-AI Assistant + Research-Driven Ecosystem Checks-and-Balances Collaborative Learning Intelligence Network (HAIA-RECCLIN) operates as a governed collective of intelligences.
Each participating AI system serves a unique verification role — Researcher, Editor, Coder, Calculator, Liaison, Ideator — under the supervision of a Human Navigator.

The Data Immunization Protocol is one of HAIA-RECCLIN’s applied governance instruments.
It ensures that every piece of data entering a model, every transformation applied to it, and every output generated from it can be traced, cross-validated, and ethically adjudicated by a human arbiter.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

The Protocol defines a public standard for:
- Detecting and isolating data poisoning or structural anomalies.
- Establishing multi-AI redundancy before fine-tuning or model training.
- Embedding human arbitration within automated integrity checks.
- Creating transparent audit trails that support reproducible research.

It may be adopted by universities, open-source research labs, and enterprise AI teams seeking verifiable governance models that go beyond “trust by assumption.”

## 3. Methodology

The Data Immunization Protocol follows the same Factics architecture applied in Growth OS — Facts + Tactics as a unified process of understanding and action.

1. Fact: LLMs can be compromised by constant-sample poisoning regardless of scale.
2. Tactic: Introduce structured multi-AI verification roles with enforced arbitration checkpoints.
3. KPI: Achieve > 95 % cross-AI agreement and < 5 % false-positive rate across validated datasets.

This triad transforms insight into measurable resilience.

## 4. Structural Roles and Functions

| Role | Function | AI Example | Oversight |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Researcher | Source verification and primary data collection | Perplexity | Navigator |
| Editor | Contextual and factual coherence | Claude | Navigator |
| Coder | Data preprocessing and transformation | Gemini | Navigator |
| Calculator | Quantitative and statistical validation | ChatGPT | Navigator |
| Liaison | Cross-model comparison and bias detection | Grok | Navigator |
| Ideator | Synthetic testing and scenario modeling | Gemini / Mistral | Navigator |
| Navigator (Human) | Arbitration, ethics, release approval | Human Arbiter | — |

## 5. Verification Flow

1. Dual-AI Ingestion: Two or more independent models analyze incoming data.
2. Cross-AI Consensus: Results are compared; variance > 10 % triggers human review.
3. Anomaly Detection: Linguistic, token, and structural anomalies are flagged.
4. Human Arbitration: The Navigator reviews all discrepancies and signs off on final inclusion or quarantine.
5. Immutable Logging: All actions are hashed and recorded for public verification.

## 6. Current Experimentation Phase

The protocol is currently deployed across three active AI systems using identical prompts.
This multi-AI testbed measures consistency, reasoning drift, and agreement accuracy.
Preliminary results show a 93 % concordance rate among independent systems, validating the potential for anomaly containment before dataset ingestion.

Future iterations will introduce:
- Automated reconciliation dashboards.
- Visual drift mapping for peer transparency.
- A public reporting mechanism for integrity audits.

## 7. Academic and Ethical Implications

The Immunization Protocol reframes AI safety as an epistemic and organizational discipline, not only a technical one.
It offers a structure for research reproducibility, shared accountability, and ethical auditability across systems.
By institutionalizing dissent and arbitration, HAIA-RECCLIN ensures that disagreement between intelligences becomes a signal for review, not an error to suppress.

---

## 8. Participation and Collaboration

This repository invites public researchers to:
- Reproduce and test the protocol under their own AI configurations.
- Contribute to cross-model divergence studies.
- Submit datasets and anomaly reports for shared audit cycles.

Regular Integrity Audit Sessions will review submissions, document divergences, and update the public ledger of known inconsistencies.
